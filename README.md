# IPv4RangeExplorer

IPv4RangeExplorer is a C++ program that allows users to input two IPv4 addresses representing a range and lists all the addresses within that range. It leverages the `IPv4` class to handle IP address parsing and enumeration.

## Features

- Read and display IPv4 addresses in dotted format (e.g., "192.168.1.1").
- Enumerate IP addresses within a specified range.
- Simple and easy-to-use console interface.

## Example
Please enter the start IP address in dotted format: 192.168.1.1
Please enter the end IP address in dotted format: 192.168.1.5
( 192 , 168 , 1 , 1 ) ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 2 ) ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 3 ) ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 4 ) ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 5 )
